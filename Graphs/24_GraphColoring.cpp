// Graph Colouring Problem
// Two Types  Problems: 1. 2-colouring => a). Is Graph Bipartite b). Possible Bipartition

/*
There are three types of graph coloring Problem : 
1. Edge Colour
2. Surface Coloring
3. Vertex Colour || Node Colouring

Third Type is much important
*/

/*
Chromatic number : The minimum number of colors that are required to color the graph G called as 
Chromatic Number.
*/




// a. Is Graph Bipartite and Possible partition















// b. m-colouring =============> by Two Ways
//   1. By Recursion and Backtracking                 Strivers video





























// 2. By Normal Greedy   =============> Code Library Approach
