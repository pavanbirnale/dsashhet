// Maximum sum of absolute difference of an array
// Article 
// here we have given and array we have to find what is the abolute differance of there element which is maximum

// according to article arrange the alternative maximum and minimum then subtract i frrom i+1 and at last subtract lsat from zero individualy


// my approch sort the array incressing and decressinhg order and take differance of all the elem but but but here space (Sorry original aproch also use spzce) 
// is come in picture so above approch is nice
